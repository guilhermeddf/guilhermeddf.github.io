          <p>PerfMiner is a tool that allows the identification of performance deviations during the evolution of software systems. This paper describes the experience of applying and adaptating the PerfMiner tool to the performance analysis of large-scale web information systems. The main result of this experience is the development of the Visum tool that allows detecting, analyzing and comparing performance deviations that occur in testing and production environments of a system. We also report performance issues of 4 different categories found in the analyzed systems, as well as specific refactorings that can help to address them. Finally, we also present discussions and lessons learned related to the automation of performance evaluation activities using our tools.</p>

          <p>Context: The concept of technical debt is a metaphor that contextualizes problems faced during software evolution that reflect technical compromises in tasks that are not carried out adequately during their development they can yield short-term benefit to the project in terms of increased productivity and lower cost, but that may have to be paid off with interest later. Objective: This work investigates the current state of the art of technical debt tools by identifying which activities, functionalities and kind of technical debt are handled by existing tools that support the technical debt management in software projects. Method: A systematic mapping study is performed to identify and analyze available tools for managing technical debt based on a set of five research questions. Results: The work contributes with (i) a systematic mappping of current research on the field, (ii) a highlight of the most referenced tools, their main characteristics, their supported technical debt types and activities, and (iii) a discussion of emerging findings and implications for future research. Conclusions: Our study identified 50 TD tools where 42 of them are new tools, and 8 tools extend an existing one. Most of the tools address technical debt related to code, design, and/or architecture artifacts. Besides, the different TD management activities received different levels of attention. For example, TD identification is supported by 80% of the tools, whereas 30% of them handle the TD documentation activity. Tools that deal with TD identification and measurement activities are still predominant. However, we observed that recent tools focusing onTD prevention, replacement, and prioritization activities represent emergent research trends.</p>

        <p>Continuous Integration (CI) is a widely adopted practice that automates and enhances the frequency of code integration. Previous research has explored the relationship between CI sub-practices (such as frequent commit activity and high test coverage) and software quality. However, limited knowledge exists regarding the impact of specific CI sub-practices on the Continuous Code Quality (CCQ) inspection outcomes of software projects, such as technical debts, bug density, duplicated lines, and code smells. This paper aims to analyze the extent to which the adoption of CI sub-practices improves CCQ outcome metrics in software projects. First, we investigate the association between Travis CI adoption, Travis CI usage maturity, and improved quality inspection outcomes in a set of 75 popular open-source projects from GitHub. Additionally, we use data from other 97 open-source projects to identify specific CI sub-practices, such as maintaining shorter build durations, that exhibit a strong correlation with enhanced quality inspection outcomes. Our findings reveal that the quality inspection outcomes are improved in projects with higher test coverage and shorter build duration. Merely adopting a CI service is not a guarantee for improved quality outcomes. Therefore, it is essential for developers to consistently adhere to recommended CI sub-practices. By doing so, they can effectively harness the benefits of CI in their projects and achieve improved quality outcomes.</p>
